## Vedeu Events

Vedeu provides an event mechanism to facilitate the functionality of your
application. The events are either Vedeu defined, ie. system events or 
user defined, ie. user events.


### System Events

System events generally control the internal state of Vedeu with respects to
your application.

Note: System events can be handled or triggered by your application also, but
this may lead to unexpected side-effects.


### User Events

User events allow you to orchestrate behaviour within your application, ie. the user presses a specific key, you trigger an event to make something happen. Eg. pressing 'p' instructs the player to play.
