# Vedeu Views

Each interface defined in Vedeu will have an associated (by name, of
course) view. This view will contain that which is visible within the
interface and is determined by the position of the cursor associated
with the interface.

- A view is made up of {file:docs/lines.md Lines}.
- A view can also be derived from a
  {file:docs/templates.md View Template}.

Views can be requested to be drawn immediately on construction, or
added to a {file:docs/buffer.md Buffer}.
