# Vedeu Groups

Vedeu allows you to create collections of interfaces, these are called
Groups.

- They have a name, which means you can control a collection of
  interfaces by this name.
- Interfaces which are part of a group are the members of that group.
  - It is generally wise not to have interfaces which are members of
    multiple groups.
- They can be visible or invisible, this affects all of the members of
  the group.
