Here's a simple example that will be displayed in the main interface of the
application. It's a multi-line affair, composed of words, punctuation and
with no doubt, bad grammar. An empty line follows:

Now, this line contains a <%= colours({ fg: '#ff0000', bg: '#000000' }) { 'red' } %> word. Whilst
this has a <% foreground('#33aa33') do %>green foreground<% end %> or
<% background('#33aa33') do %>green background<% end %>. There's also a short
syntax being used <%= fg('#0000ff') { 'here' } %> and <%= bg('#0000ff') { 'here' } %>.
