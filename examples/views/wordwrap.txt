Hydrogen is a chemical element with chemical symbol H and atomic
number 1. With an atomic weight of 1.00794 u, hydrogen is the lightest
element on the periodic table. Its monatomic form (H) is the most
abundant chemical substance in the Universe, constituting roughly 75%
of all baryonic mass. Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of
hydrogen in its plasma state. The most common isotope of hydrogen,
termed protium (name rarely used, symbol 1H), has one proton and no
neutrons.
