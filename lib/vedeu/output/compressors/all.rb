    # Provides different mechanisms to compress content. Compressing
    # content is performed to:
    #
    # 1) Reduce the amount of data sent to the renderer with each
    #    refresh or render.
    # 2) Reduce the time spent converting a terminal buffer into data
    #    suitable to send to the renderer.
