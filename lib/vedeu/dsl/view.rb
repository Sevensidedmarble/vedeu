    # DSL for creating collections of interfaces.
    #
    # Views with Vedeu are made up of simple building blocks. These
    # blocks can be arranged in a multitude of ways which I hope is
    # more than sufficient for your design needs.

    # - A view (`View`) is made up of one or more interfaces.
    # - An interface is an area on the screen where you can take input
    #   or direct output. You will define it's colour and style, its
    #   dimensions, including position and give it a name. You can
    #   then direct the output of a command, or event, to this
    #   interface and Vedeu will ensure the content is placed there.
    # - Interfaces (`Interface`) are made up of lines (`Line`), their
    #   length being the width of the interface and their number being
    #   the height of the interface.
    # - An interface with `width: 12, height: 5` will have five lines,
    #   each made of 12 characters- providing 60 cells. Colours and
    #   styles are handled by terminal escape sequences and therefore
    #   do not consume a cell.
    # - Lines are made up of zero, one or multiple streams which are
    #   basically subsets of the line.
    # - An interface, line or stream can have a colour attribute.
    # - An interface, line or stream can have a style attribute.
    # - Interfaces have a position (`y`, `x`) on the screen, and a
    #   size. (`width`, `height`)
    # - Interfaces can be placed relative to each other based on their
    #   attributes.
    #   - An interface has a `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`.
    #   - An interface also has a `north` and `west` (`top` and `left`
    #     minus 1 respectively).
    #   - An interface also has a `south` and `east` (`bottom` and
    #     `right` plus 1 respectively).
    # - Colours are defined in CSS-style values, i.e. `#ff0000` would
    #   be red.
    # - Styles are named. See the table below for supported styles.
