module Vedeu

  # Provides a mechanism for storing and retrieving events by name. A single
  # name can contain many events. Also, an event can trigger other events.
  #
  # @todo I really don't like the 'hashiness' of this. (GL 2014-10-29)

    # Register an event by name with optional delay (throttling) which when
    # triggered will execute the code contained within the passed block.
    #
    # @param name  [Symbol] The name of the event which will be triggered later.
    # @param [Hash] opts The options to register the event with.
    # @option opts :delay [Fixnum|Float] Limits the execution of the
    #   triggered event to only execute when first triggered, with subsequent
    #   triggering being ignored until the delay has expired.
    # @option opts :debounce [Fixnum|Float] Limits the execution of the
    #   triggered event to only execute once the debounce has expired.
    #   Subsequent triggers before debounce expiry are ignored.
    # @param block [Proc] The event to be executed when triggered. This block
    #   could be a method call, or the triggering of another event, or sequence
    #   of either/both.
    #
    # @example
    #   Vedeu.event :my_event do |some, args|
